### Cool but aging projects I built

- [Inker](http://inker.position-absolute.com/) - A framework to build and send transactional emails
- [Scrum Release Notes Mobile App](http://releasenotes.position-absolute.com/) - An easy way to stay inform on how your Scrum projects are doing.

### About my open source projects
  
Once upon a time, I was a very active open source contributor. While I am proud of my contributions, these projects are older and do not use modern best practices. 

The latest open source project I built was never completed (already 2 years ago), [Inker2](https://github.com/posabsolute/inker2), a small service for email delivery built in Typescript.
