### About my open source projects
  
Once upon a time, I was a very active open source contributor. While I am proud of my contributions, these projects are older and do not use modern best practices. 

The latest open source project I made was never completed (already 3 years ago), [Inker2](https://github.com/posabsolute/inker2), a small service for email delivery built in Typescript. 

I also created and maintained for a couple of years one of the most popular [jQuery form validation](https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine) library; it was launched on Google Code in 2011.
