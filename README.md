### Cool but aging projects I built

- [Inker](http://inker.position-absolute.com/) - A framework to build and send transactional emails (2015).
- [Scrum Release Notes Mobile App](http://releasenotes.position-absolute.com/) - An easy way to stay inform on how your Scrum projects are doing (2016).

### Blog Posts

For many years I maintained **position-absolute.com**, it started at the height of jQuery and was a great way to share my adventures. I have kept a few of my favorite posts here.

### About my open source projects
  
Once upon a time, I was a very active open source contributor. While I am proud of my contributions, these projects are older and do not use modern best practices. 

The latest open source project I made was never completed (already 3 years ago), [Inker2](https://github.com/posabsolute/inker2), a small service for email delivery built in Typescript. 

I also created and maintained for a couple of years one of the most popular [jQuery form validation](https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine) libraries; it was launched on Google Code in 2011.
